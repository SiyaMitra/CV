  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.
    <br>
    Leadership is the ability to inspire a team to achieve a certain goal.<br>
    It is a process by which an Leader can inspire, guide & influence the behavior & work of others towards accomplishment of specific goal.
    Itâ€™s usually discussed in the context of business, but leadership is also how you as an individual chose to lead your life.

    You donâ€™t have to be a CEO, manager or even a team lead to be a leader. Leadership is a set of skills â€“ and a certain psychology that anyone can master.

  <h3 style="font-size:160%;">Importance of Leadership</h3>
  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">
    The importance of leadership lies in the ability to get things done.Â 
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>
      Leadership allows you to communicate a clear vision
    </li>
    <li>
      Unite your team around that vision
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to make strategic and visionary decisions
    </li>
    <li>
      Convince others to follow those decisions
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3 style="font-size:160%;">How Leadership Works</h3>
  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">
    <strong>Effective leadership</strong> includes exhibiting a strong character
  </p>
  <ul>
    âœ… Honesty
    <br>
    âœ… Integrity
    <br>
    âœ… Trustworthiness
    <br>
    âœ… Ethics
  </ul>
  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">
    <strong>Strong Leadership</strong> involves clear communication skills. Leaders speak with and listen to staff members,
    respond to questions and concerns, and are empathetic.
    <br>
    <strong>True leadership</strong> sees where the company is heading, Visualizing what is possible, following trends in the industry,
    and taking risks to grow the business are all required of leaders.
  </p>
  <h3 style="font-size:160%;">Leadership Style</h3>
  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">
  <p style="list-style-type:square">
    Similarly, leadership experts believe there are different types of leadership styles and that some leaders have a dominant single style,
    while other leaders use different styles in different situations or with different followers.
    <br>
    Commonly identified leadership styles include affiliative, authoritative, coaching, coercive, charismatic, democratic,
    innovative, command and control (or bureaucratic), laissez-faire, pacesetter (or transactional), servant, situational and transformational.
  </p>
  <h3 style="font-size:160%;">Secrets of Leadership</h3>
  <p style="font-family:cambria;">
  <p style="font-size:100%;">
    A common misconception about leadership is that itâ€™s something youâ€™re born with â€“ that the greatest leaders the world has seen were
    born with some innate magical quality that allows them to lead better than others. But thatâ€™s simply not true.
    <br>
    There are all sorts of different leaders in this world with myriad goals theyâ€™re aiming for, but there are a distinct set of learned qualities and styles that unify the best leaders.
    They are committed to using time, dedication, consistency and a distinct purpose to achieve their goals. You, too, can cultivate these skills and become one of the greats.Â By mastering your own set of leadership skills.

        a person who can influence and lead your team toward that ideaâ€™s fruition.</strong></em>
